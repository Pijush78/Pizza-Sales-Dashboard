## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project visualizes and interprets pizza sales data to answer key business questions such as:
- Which pizza categories and sizes drive the most revenue and orders?  
- What are the busiest days of the week and peak months?  
- Who are the best and worst sellers by revenue, quantity, and total orders?  
- How does order behavior vary by time (daily, monthly) and seasonality?

The dashboard is organized into multiple views, including:
- Overall sales KPIs (Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, Avg Pizza/Order)  
- Temporal trends (daily and monthly order trends)  
- Category & size breakdowns  
- Top and bottom performers (by revenue, quantity, and order count)  
- Busy day/time insights for operational planning
